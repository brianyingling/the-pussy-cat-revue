            A long, long time ago...in a time before television, the internet, and cellphones...live
            entertainment was king. If you wanted to see a show you had to leave the house. Shows from
            this era were often a mishmash of song, dance, comedy, music, sketches, magic, circus, and
            more. This style of entertainment called vaudeville reigned supreme for over 50 years but
            quickly fell into disfavor after the advent of talking pictures and television.
            People say that “variety is still dead.” Meanwhile, millions are watching shows such as
            <em>America’s Got Talent</em> and <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>. New York City has had a steadily growing
            neoburlesque and variety movement since the late 1990’s. Currently there are numerous small
            shows running in these genres. However there is nothing on the grand scale of the shows from
            variety’s heyday.</p>
            <p><em>The Pussycat Revue</em> is a pastiche of genres which never co-existed under a single roof in the
            past. However what we are trying to do is throw a show the likes of which New York City hasn’t
            seen in over 80 years. We are going to present traditional variety acts, classic burlesque dance,
            and swing music in a Broadway-size spectacle. In addition, <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> will feature all
            live music. Much more than a show <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> is an attempt to bring people back to a
            classier time. When people dressed up to go out, and men took off their hats inside. The old-
            style nightclub atmosphere, and classic cocktails at <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> alone would make for
            a fine evening out.</p>

                            Minsky was one of the most famous names in burlesque. The Republic on 42nd St. was their
                            flagship location. For the first time burlesque was featured side-by-side with Broadway shows.
                            Today Minsky’s Republic is the New Victory Theater which is New York City’s largest theater for
                            children and families. A burlesque show from that era was on the scale of a Broadway show
                            unlike the small cabaret shows of today. The goal of <em>The Pussy Cat Revue</em> is to bring back
                            burlesque and variety to the glory days of yesteryear.

                              <em>The Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic</em> is one of many productions that inspired <em>The Pussycat Revue</em>.
                              It was a racy late-night show featuring some of the biggest talent of the time. It was intended for
                              people to go to after a Broadway show. What is there for you to do today in Times Square when
                              you get out of a show? New York City needs a show like <em>The Pussycat Revue</em>!

                              The Palace was the most famous of all Vaudeville theaters.  It was built in 1913 by E.F. Albee
                              and Martin Beck to be the flagship location of their chain. Playing at the Palace was considered
                              a mark of success you truly made it in vaudeville once you played the Palace. The Palace still 
                              stands today, and currently a Broadway house. Interestingly it is one of only three current
                              Broadway theaters whose street address is on Broadway.

            <h2>Investor Information</h2>
            <p>
            Does <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> sound like fun to you? Is it something you would like to be a part of?
            You are being offered an investment opportunity unlike any other you ever have before whether
            you are an experienced entertainment investor or a novice. A show like this has a wide range of
            appeal. It will attract the theater audience and also many people who would not typically go out
            to a theatrical presentation. A typical audience at <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> would most likely be full
            of professionals in their twenties through forties. A group which in New York City has disposable
            income and likes to go out and live it up. <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> has the potential to be popular
            with middle-aged people and up because it will bring back memories of films and television
            shows from their youth.</p>
            <p>
            You may say “variety is dead,”  “entertainment is a risky investment,” and “the cast size will be
            too big you’ll never make money.”  I hope this webpage has helped to make a case that variety
            is alive and well and that there is a potential to make money. If you know anything at all about
            investing in entertainment you know it is risky and only one out of five projects reach the
            breakeven point. <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> has many advantages over a traditional show. The
            biggest is that there is no script. Acts can be tweaked to work better or removed. The order can
            be changed as needed. New acts can be added whenever we like. We can do seasonal shows
            and insert topical humor. Last but not least are shows out there with large casts making money.
            If they can do it so can we.</p>
            <p>
            Producing a show in New York is only the beginning of the potential for <em>The Pussycat Revue</em>.
            Vaudeville and burlesque were run by some of the greatest entrepreneurs of the twentieth
            century, and had circuits that spanned the entire country. There is no reason why some of these
            old business models cannot work today. By expanding to others cities <em>The Pussycat Revue</em>
            could begin its own circuit greatly increasing the quality of our show and keep more people
            working full time. Cirque du Soleil is a great example of a company that has different shows
            playing all over the world.</p>
            <p>
            We are looking for accredited investors or at least people who are eligible to help with our
            capitalization efforts. We need to secure a venue before we talk numbers because there are too
            many variables involved. If <em>The Pussycat Revue</em> sounds like something you would like to be a
            part of please fill out the contact form below for more information.</p>
